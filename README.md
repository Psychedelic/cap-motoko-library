# The CAP (Certified Asset Provenance) Motoko Library

Transaction history & asset provenance for NFTâ€™s & Tokens on the Internet Computer

> CAP is an open internet service providing transaction history & asset provenance for NFTâ€™s & Tokens on the Internet Computer. It solves the huge IC problem that assets donâ€™t have native transaction history, and does so in a scalable, trustless and seamless way so any NFT/Token can integrate with one line of code.

## ðŸ‘‹ Getting started

You're required to have [Vessel Motoko package manager](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel) binary installed and configured in your operating system.

Here's a quick breakdown, but use the original documentation for latest details:

- Download a copy of the [vessel binary](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel/releases) from the [release page](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel/releases) or build one yourself
- Run vessel init in your project root.

  ```sh
  vessel init
  ```

- Edit `package-set.dhall` to include the [Cap Motoko Library](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-motoko-library) as described in [add the library to a project](#add-the-library-to-a-project).

- Include the `vessel sources` command in the `build > packtool` of your `dfx.json`

  ```sh
  ...
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": "vessel sources"
    }
  }
  ...
  ```

- From then on, you can simply run the [dfx build command](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference/dfx-build.html)

  ```sh
  dfx build
  ```

## ðŸ¤– Add the library to a project

After you have initialised [Vessel](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel), edit the `package-set.dhall` and include the [Cap Motoko library](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-motoko-library) and the version, as available in the releases of [Cap Motoko Library](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-motoko-library).

In the example below of our `package-set.dhall`, we are using `v1.0.0`:

```sh
let upstream = https://github.com/dfinity/vessel-package-set/releases/download/mo-0.6.7-20210818/package-set.dhall sha256:c4bd3b9ffaf6b48d21841545306d9f69b57e79ce3b1ac5e1f63b068ca4f89957
let Package =
    { name : Text, version : Text, repo : Text, dependencies : List Text }

let
  additions =
      [{ name = "base"
      , repo = "https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-motoko-library"
      , version = "v1.0.0"
      , dependencies = [] : List Text
      }] : List Package

in  upstream # additions
```

## ðŸš€ Release

**TLDR; Common tag release process, which should be automated shortly by a semanatic release process in the CI**

Create a new tag for the branch commit, you'd like to tag (e.g. for v1.0.0):

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
```

Complete by pushing the tags to remote:

```sh
git push origin --tags
```
